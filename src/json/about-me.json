    "paragraph": "I am a product manager, full-stack developer, and team player. I learned about resource allocation and general finance in business. After school, I worked in insurance where I learned about managing and estimating risk. Afterward, I moved to retail e-commerce, where I conducted financial planning and analysis. Then I transitioned to tech, semi-conductor industry, where I helped taking new tech products to the market. Two years ago, I joined a casual mobile game company, where I led new feature development for the organization. If there's anything in common in my past, it would be that I enjoy constantly learning!"
